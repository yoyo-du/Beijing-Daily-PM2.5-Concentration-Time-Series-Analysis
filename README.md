# Beijing-Daily-PM2.5-Concentration-Time-Series-Analysis
STA 560 Time Series Analysis

I analyzed the Beijing PM2.5 data provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository. Two time series models are discussed to deal with Beijing daily PM2.5 concentration prediction, including Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and regression model adding an ARIMA structure (ARIMAX) model. The results show that the
ARIMAX model have a better performance than ARMA model in fitting and forecasting daily PM2.5 values and trends because there exists covariate time series.

The dataset was retrieved from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+Multi-Site+Air-Quality+Data
